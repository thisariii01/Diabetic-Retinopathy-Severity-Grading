# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Severity-Grading

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity grading involves the classification of retinal images into five levels of severity ranging from 0 to 4, representing No DR, Mild Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (Mild NPDR), Moderate NPDR, Severe NPDR, and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). With the advancement of Deep Learning techniques, recent studies have employed various architectures and models to grade these severity levels of DR, aiding timely diagnosis and treatment for diabetic patients. This repository explores the recent works involved in grading the severity of DR and our approach to solving the problem using Image Processing and Machine Vision techniques, including the preprocessing of retinal fundus images, the training of a machine learning model, and assessing its performance metrics.
